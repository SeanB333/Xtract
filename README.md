> ### MVP

Allowing the User to upload thier code snippets and log them into a database that will log thier info and save thier code. The user will also be able to search the database for **Xtract** ed code and purchase snips from other users.


> ### Stretch Goals

The user will be able to log in to thier personal profile that shows thier snips either for **sale** or **trade** and the snips that they have saved for future transactions. The development team will analyze the uploaded code and determine if the code is worth being purchased and polished for future sale or trade by **Xtract**
